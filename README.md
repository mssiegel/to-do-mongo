# to-do-mongo
Web app that lets you separate projects into categories: "Blocked", "Todo", "In-Progress", "Completed"

Built using the MERN stack of MongoDB, Express, Node, and React. 

Web app that displays editable anheuser-busch card components. Back end uses Node, Express, MongoDB. Front end built using create-react-app.
Components can be Read, Created, and Updated. (Components cannot be deleted as instructions did not say to do make that possible)

To get started, run:
1. ```npm run server-install```
2. ```npm run client-install```
3. ```npm run dev```

Doing so will start a node server on port 5000 and a react client on port 3000
